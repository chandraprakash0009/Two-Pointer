## 42. Trapping Rain Water

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

 

Example 1:


Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
Example 2:

Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
 

Constraints:

n == height.length
1 <= n <= 2 * 104
0 <= height[i] <= 105


### Approach

Width of each wall is one , it means that if there are wall of height "h" between two large wall then the the wall will take the volume of h beacause
    l = 1 .....(single wall)
    b = 1 .....(given)
    h  = given
    So, volume = lbh = h (beacause l=b=1);  
    
Algorithm -    

Step-1 --> take two pinter to find the such that there could be some water.  
Step-2 --> find the volume between those wall and add it to answer.  
Step-3 --> Subtract the height of each wall in between those two wall.   
Step-4 --> If there is no larger or equal wall is found, it means that there is a decreasing height further . So , apply the same operation but from rightmost to current index.

### Java code
```
class Solution {
    public int trap(int[] height) {
        if(height.length==1){return 0;}
        int sum=0;
        int low=0;
        while(low<height.length && height[low]==0){ low++; }
        if(low>=height.length-1){return 0;}
        //int high=low+1;
        while(low<height.length){
            int high=low+1;
            while(high<height.length && height[high]<height[low]){high++;}
            if(high==height.length){
                int ans = func(height,low);
                return ans+sum;
            }
            sum+= (Math.min(height[low],height[high])*(high-low-1));
            for(int i=low+1; i<high; i++){ sum-=height[i];}
            low=high;
        }
        return sum;
    }
    private int func(int nums[], int idx){
        int sum=0;
        int high=nums.length-1;
        while(high>idx){
            int i=high-1;
            while(i>=idx && nums[i]<nums[high]){i--;}
            sum+= Math.min(nums[i],nums[high])*(high-i-1);
            for(int j=i+1; j<high; j++){ sum-=nums[j]; }
            high=i;
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
